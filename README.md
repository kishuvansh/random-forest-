#  **Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning**

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health metrics. Utilizing a Random Forest classifier, the model analyzes features such as age, BMI, HbA1c levels, and medical history to generate predictions. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, achieving robust performance in diabetes risk assessment.

# Project Overview
Diabetes prediction plays a crucial role in preventive healthcare. This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for binary classification of diabetes status using clinical data. The implementation focuses on:
Handling missing values and categorical data
Normalizing numerical features
Training a Random Forest classifier
Evaluating model performance using standard metrics
The model serves as a foundation for clinical decision support systems and risk stratification tools.
